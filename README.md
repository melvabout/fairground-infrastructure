Working through [Kubernetes the hardway](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). Combining this repo with [fairground-machine-images](https://github.com/melvabout/fairground-machine-images) and [python-lambda-populate-hosts](https://github.com/melvabout/python-lambda-populate-hosts) you have everything up to and including [step 9](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/09-bootstrapping-kubernetes-workers.md). More to follow.
